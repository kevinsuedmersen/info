\textbf{Predicting Bitcoin Prices 2.0 - Is attention really all we need?} 

\noindent In this private, trial project, I am training a Natural Language Processing model, the Transformer, on text data scraped from the Reuters Business News Archive and another time-series model on Bitcoin transaction data. After both models have been trained separately, I am combining the predictions of both models in a meta model to generate the final Bitcoin price predictions. In the end, I am planning to automate the whole process with Apache Airflow. For more details click \href{https://github.com/kevinsuedmersen/predicting_bitcoin_prices_2.0}{\color{blue} here}.
